NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::Params::Hashed - Access to parameters like
    "name[index]" as hashes for Catalyst::Request.

SYNOPSIS
        #
        # application class
        #
        package TestApp;

        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;
        use Catalyst qw/ ......... /;
        extends 'Catalyst';
        use CatalystX::RoleApplicator;

            Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::Params::Hashed
        /);

        #
        # controller class
        #
        package TestApp::Controller::Test;
        .........
            # query string was like
            # site[name1]=100&site[name1]=150&site[name2]=200
            my $site = $c->req->hashed_params->{site};

            # $site is hashref:
            #
            # $site = {
            #   name1 => [100, 150],
            #   name2 => 200,
            # }
        .........

DESCRIPTION
    You can access "hashed_parameters", "hashed_query_parameters",
    "hashed_body_parameters" to get access to parameters as to hashes. Also
    you can use "hashes_params", "hashed_query_params" and
    "hashed_body_params" as shortcuts. Or, if you too lazy, you can use
    "hparams", "hquery_params" and "hbody_params" :)

    Note, that this trait gives you read-only version of "params",
    "query_params" and "body_params" respectively. Also note, that any
    change to any of three above <WILL NOT HAVE> any effect to all of
    "hashed*params".

METHODS
  hashed_params
  hparams
  hashed_query_params
  hquery_params
  hashed_body_params
  hbody_params
TODO
    Write tests.
